In our application, we have a section for upcoming artists to upload their own music. When uploading songs, the artists add their own tags, but other users can add tags to the songs later on.

For this version of the app, we are provided a song_data dictionary as well as a few tags from users in the form of strings.

For the first step, create a new set called tag_set from the original songâ€™s tags located in song_data.

Next, add the three user tag strings to tag_set.

Finally, update song_data so that the value of the key, 'Retro Words' is equal to the updated tag set.
