1.
For these checkpoints, we will review the different operations which you can perform on set and frozenset containers.

First, create a frozenset called my_tags which contains the elements: 'pop', 'electronic', 'relaxing', 'slow', and 'synth'.

2.
Try finding the union of music_tags and my_tags, but make sure to return the result as a frozenset. Store the result in a variable called frozen_tag_union.

3.
Now store the intersection of music_tags and my_tags into a variable called regular_tag_intersect. Make sure that it is stored as a normal set this time.

4.
Now try finding the difference of my_tags with music_tags. Store this result in a variable called frozen_tag_difference. The type of the result should be a frozenset.

5.
Finally, get the symmetric difference of music_tags with my_tags and store it in a variable called regular_tag_sd. The result should should be a set and not a frozenset.
