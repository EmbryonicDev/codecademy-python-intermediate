To improve the logic for adding user tags to songs in the app, we can use the union of tag sets! Our team has provided us two dictionaries.

The first dictionary (song_data) contains song data including tags from the original artists, while the second dictionary (user_tag_data) includes tags that have been added by users. Letâ€™s attempt to merge the tag sets together so we have a full collection of tags.

First, create an empty dictionary called new_song_data which will hold the merged tag data.

2.
Our goal now is to consolidate the tags into one dictionary for each category. To accomplish this we need to:

Loop over song_data.items() (all the items in song_data)

On each iteration of the loop, create a set for each category of tags. This will require creating two new sets, one for song_data and one for user_tag_data.

In addition to creating the sets on each iteration, create a new key inside of new_song_data for each category and set the value to be a union of the two new sets.

Print new_song_data to see the result!
