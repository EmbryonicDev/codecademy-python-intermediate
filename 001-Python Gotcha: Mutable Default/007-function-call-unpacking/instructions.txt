    Looks like we are ready to give our function a test run! Luckily, table seven at Jihoâ€™s restaurant is ready to pay.

    Define a list called table_7_total that has the following values in order:

    534.50 (Representing the total bill cost)
    20.0 (Representing the tip percentage)
    5 (Representing the number of people to split the bill for)

    Using the unpacking operator, call calculate_price_per_person() with the list table_7_total.
