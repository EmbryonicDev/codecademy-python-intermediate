    Letâ€™s start by defining a function called single_prix_fixe_order() which will define four parameters to accept the full order:

    A parameter named appetizer
    A parameter named entrees paired with a * operator
    A parameter named sides
    A parameter named dessert_scoops paired with a ** operator
    Our function should simply have four print() statements that print each individual parameter.

    We got our first prix fixe order in! The customer wants the following:

    'Baby Beets' as an appetizer
    'Salmon' and 'Scallops' as entrees
    'Mashed Potatoes' as a side
    A scoop of 'Vanilla' ice cream and a scoop of 'Cookies and Cream' for dessert
    Utilize our function single_prix_fixe_order() to print out all of the customers order.
