Letâ€™s return to our poem context manager. This time, we want to start transferring poems from a poem.txt file to a card.txt file. We plan to create some poem greeting cards for all our friends!

Write a nested context manager that uses the poem_files context manager to open poem.txt in read mode and saves it to a variable called poem

Nested inside, use the card_files context manager to open the card.txt file in write mode and saves it to a variable called card.

Print poem and card to confirm we can access both files.

Finally, inside of our nested context managers, and under our print statements, write to card.txt the contents of poem.txt.
