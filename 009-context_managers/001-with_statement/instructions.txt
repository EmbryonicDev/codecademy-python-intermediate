1.
Take a look at the code in the text editor. Notice that the file ('file_name.txt') was opened but never closed. This is bad practice and could lead to errors down the road.

Update this script by:

Putting the code that opens the file inside a try block
Closing open_file in a finally block using .close()

2.
Now rewrite this script in with statement form using open_file as the target variable. Use the "r" mode for read permissions.
