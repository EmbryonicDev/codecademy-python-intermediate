Let’s create a context manager that will work with files filled with creative poems. While we won’t directly work with a file in this exercise, make sure to note the order of method execution in a context manager. Don’t worry, we’ll work with an actual file soon! For now, we are just going to get comfortable with the basics.

Create a class called PoemFiles. For now, give it a single pass statement so it won’t create an error when run.

2.
Next, remove the pass statement and create an __init__ method inside of the PoemFiles class that prints 'Creating Poems!'

3.
Let’s implement the __enter__ method. Have the method print 'Opening poem file'.

4.
Lastly, create an __exit__ method that prints 'Closing poem file'.

5.
Awesome! Now we have our very own context manager! Let’s see it in action by calling it with a with statement.

Have the with statement save the invoked class to a variable called manager and have it print a famous line from the poet Emily Dickinson: 'Hope is the thing with feathers'.
