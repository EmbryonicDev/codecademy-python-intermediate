1.
Let’s create our PoemFiles context manager from previous exercises. First, import contextmanager from contextlib.

2.
Now, let’s create a generator function called poem_files that has two parameters file and mode. The function should do two things:

Print 'Opening File'
Open the file using open() with the file and mode parameters, and save the result to a variable called open_poem_file.
Don’t forget to decorate it with the @contextmanager decorator.

3.
Next, we will have to create the try/finally structure. Inside of the function write the try clause, and inside of it use the yield keyword to yield the open_poem_file variable.

4.
Now, let’s finish the try/finally block by writing a finally clause that does two things:

Print 'Closing File'
Call close() on the open_poem_file variable.
