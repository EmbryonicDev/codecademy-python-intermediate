1.
    Since our program now requires a distinction between food items and drinks, this is a great place to utilize the power of **kwargs.

    Define a function called assign_food_items() that has one parameter, order_items. Pair this parameter with a ** operator to handle any keyword arguments.

    For now, just have the function print order_items.

2.
    Now we want to capture the food items and drinks in order_items. Use the .get() method to do the following:

    Capture the values from a keyword argument called food and assign it to a variable called food
    Capture the values from a keyword argument called drinks and assign it to a variable called drinks
    Refer to the commented example call at the bottom of the script for a reference on how we will call this function later on.

3.
    Lastly, inside of our function use print() to output the food variable and another print() to output the drinks variable.
