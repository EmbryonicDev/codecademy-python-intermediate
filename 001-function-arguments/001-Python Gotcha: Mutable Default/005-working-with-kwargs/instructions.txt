    Unfortunately, when we originally implemented assign_food_items we did not assign the values we capture into our tables dictionary.

    Adjust the function definition of assign_food_items():

    Add a positional parameter called table_number followed by the **order_items parameter we already defined.
    Uncomment the 2 lines inside the function.
    Adding the parameter and uncommenting the lines will now allow us to assign the food to a specific table.

    Great! Now that we have the base functionality set up, letâ€™s give it a test run. Luckily a new customer named Douglas just came in and is ready to place an order.

    Under print('\n --- tables after update --- \n'), call the assign_food_items() function with the following arguments:

    A positional argument table_number with the value 2
    A keyword argument food with the value 'Seabass, Gnocchi, Pizza'
    A keyword argument drinks with the value 'Margarita, Water'
    Print tables to see the change!
