1 - Jiho needs a way to assign new customers to the existing tables as they come in for their reservations. Define a new function called assign_table that will take three arguments (in this exact order):
table_number
name
vip_status
Our function assign_table should then use the following arguments to assign a new customer to a table in our dictionary tables. Use the table_number as the key and a list containing name and vip_status as the value.

2 - Looks like our first reservation just came in!

    Call our function assign_table using positional arguments for a customer with the name of 'Yoni' to the table 6. Yoni does not have VIP status and thus should have the value False.

    Optionally, print tables to check that the assignment was successful.

3 - Looks like another customer came in.

    Call assign_table using keyword arguments (in any order) to add the new customer with the following details:

    Name: 'Martha'
    Table: 3
    VIP Status: True
    Make sure to include the keywords in your call to the function!

    Optionally, print tables to check that the assignment was successful.

4 - Since most customers are new at the restaurant,
we want to use a default value of False for any new table assignment.

    Modify the function definition of assign_table and give the parameter vip_status a default value of False.

5 - A new customer just arrived. Add the customer to a table using the
following information via positional arguments:

    Name: 'Karla'
    Table Number: 4
    Karla is not a VIP, so we do not need to provide an additional argument since we already have a default value of False in our function definition.

    Lastly, print the tables dictionary, to see the final table assignments.
