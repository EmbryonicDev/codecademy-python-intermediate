1.
Take a look at the code in welcome.py. There is a syntax error on line 3 (the extra closing parenthesis).

Will any of the previous code be executed? Press “Run” to find out.


2.
Fix the error from the extra closing parenthesis from line 3. Run the code to see what happens.


3.
We hit an exception on line 3 because of the misspelled variable name! However, the previous lines of code were executed (observe Welcome to in the output) because exceptions occur at runtime.

Fix the variable name on line 3 to continue!
