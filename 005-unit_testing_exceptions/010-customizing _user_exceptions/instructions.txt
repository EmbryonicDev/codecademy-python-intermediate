1.
Let’s customize the InventoryError from our previous exercise to return a custom error message. Inside the class, replace the pass statement with an __init__ method which takes two arguments: self, and supply.

Inside the method, store supply into the variable self.supply.

2.
Define a __str__ method which returns, 'Available supply is only ' + str(self.supply).

3.
Modify raise InventoryError by passing in supply to the exception’s constructor method.
