1.
Instrument World has a program that attempts to print the price of several instruments. Take some time to examine the program and then run the code and observe the output!

What do we expect to happen?


2.
We hit a KeyError since 'Piano' is not a key in the instrument_catalog dictionary.

Let’s provide a custom message by raising the exception ourselves. To accomplish this goal we will use a simple conditional.

First, inside of print_instrument_price, add an if statement that checks whether or not the instrument parameter is found in instrument_catalog. If it is, use the provided pre-written print statement to print the price.


3.
Finally, let’s add an else block where we will print our custom KeyError exception if the key does not exist. Inside, it should raise a KeyError with the message instrument + ' is not found in instrument catalog!'.
