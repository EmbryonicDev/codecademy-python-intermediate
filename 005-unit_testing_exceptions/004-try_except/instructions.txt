Instrument World has a program that prints a staff report for all of the Instrument World locations in the staff dictionary.

Take some time to review the code. Spot any issues?


2.
We successfully printed the staff report for Austin, but we hit an exception (ZeroDivisionError) when trying to print out the ratio for Melbourne since we attempted to divide 8 by 0.

Letâ€™s use exception handling to manage this error and keep our program running. First, wrap the function call print_staff_report() in a try clause.


3.
Immediately after the try clause, add an except clause which prints 'Could not print sales report for ' + location.

Run the code and observe our exception handling!
