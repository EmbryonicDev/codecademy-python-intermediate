We need to create some tests for the airplane alert system so that the flight crew is properly notified of critical events.

Letâ€™s start by creating a class called SystemAlertTests which inherits from unittest.TestCase.


2.
We are going to create a test for any power outages that might occur on the airplane. Check out the custom exception PowerError and our function that raises the error power_outage_detected() in the alerts.py file. The file is already imported into tests.py for us.

In our SystemAlertTests class, create a test method called test_power_outage_alert().

Inside the new method, use self.assertRaises() to check that an alerts.PowerError is raised whenever alerts.power_outage_detected is called with an argument of True.

This test should pass since we are passing a value of True and the exception is raised.


3.
We are going to create a test for any water level warnings that occur on the airplane. Check out the custom exception WaterLevelWarning and our function that raises the warning water_levels_check() in the alerts.py file. The file is already imported into tests.py for us.

In our SystemAlertTests class, create a test method called test_water_levels_warning().

Inside the new method, use self.assertWarns() to check that an alerts.WaterLevelWarning is raised whenever alerts.water_levels_check is called with an argument of 150 liters.

This test should pass since we are passing a value less than 200 and a warning occurs.
