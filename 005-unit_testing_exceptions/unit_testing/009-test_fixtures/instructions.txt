In our tests.py file we have some simple tests written for the passenger check-in experience at the kiosk for Small World Air. We also have some functions we are testing written in kiosk.py.

Take some time to review the provided code in both files. Run the code to continue!

2.
We want to make sure the kiosk is powered on before we run any tests. This is a great time to setup some test fixtures!

Create a setUpClass() method which takes a single argument (cls) and calls kiosk.power_on_kiosk(). Add the @classmethod decorator on top of it!

3.
We donâ€™t want to leave the kiosk powered on after all tests are run.

Create a tearDownClass() method which takes a single argument (cls) and calls kiosk.power_off_kiosk(). Add the @classmethod decorator on top of it!

4.
We also want to make sure that customers are on the welcome page before each test runs. Create a method called setUp(). Inside of the method, call kiosk.return_to_welcome_page().
