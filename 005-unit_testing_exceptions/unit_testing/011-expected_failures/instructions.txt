The monitors in front of passenger seats on Small World planes contain a customer feedback portal. The class CustomerFeedbackTests has tests for both the survey and the complaint form.

We can find the tests in tests.py and the functions that perform feedback tasks in feedback.py. Take some time to get acquainted with the program. Run the code to move on!

Use the expectedFailure decorator to mark this test as an expected failure!
