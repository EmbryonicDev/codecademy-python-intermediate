1.
Instrument World maintains a database (in this case a large dictionary) with instrument information that any store can access.

The current program displays information from the database for a particular instrument. Take some time to look over database.py and instrument.py to get better acquainted with the program.

Run the code to examine the output!

2.
Since the database server Instrument World uses can only have a limited number of users connected to it, we want to make sure that we disconnect from it after attempting to retrieve information, even if an exception occurs.

Add a finally clause that calls database.disconnect_from_database(). Observe the output of the exception handling when we hit an exception by running the code!

3.
Change instrument to have a value of 'Kora'. Run the code to observe the finally clause executing even when we donâ€™t hit an exception.
