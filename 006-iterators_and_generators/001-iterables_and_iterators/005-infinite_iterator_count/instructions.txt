We have several 13.5lb bags of dog food to display. Our single shelving unit however can only hold a maximum of 1,000lbs. Letâ€™s figure out how many bags of food we can display!

First, import the itertools module at the top line of the code editor.

2.
Next, initialize a for loop with a count() iterator that keeps track of the weight on the shelf.

Within the for loop body:

Provide a stop condition using max_capacity to terminate the loop
Increment num_bags on each iteration.
3.
Print the num_bags result to see how many bags will fit on the shelving unit.
