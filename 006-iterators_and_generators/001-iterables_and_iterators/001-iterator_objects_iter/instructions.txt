1.
Suppose we have a list of SKUs (stock-keeping units) for products in our pet shop. Let’s examine the internal methods of the iterable sku_list.

Use dir() on sku_list and print out the result. Can you spot __iter__ in the list of methods that are printed?

2.
Let’s access the internal __iter__() method from sku_list to create our iterator object.

Create a variable called sku_iterator_object_one that is equal to calling .__iter__() on sku_list.

Lastly, print sku_iterator_object_one!
