1.
Using our dog food dictionary called dog_foods, create a variable called dog_food_iterator that stores the value of calling iter() on our iterable dog_foods.

2.
Retrieve the first value of the dog_food_iterator using the built-in function next() and set it to a variable called next_dog_food1.

Print next_dog_food1 to see the result.

3.
Retrieve the next two values of the dog_food_iterator using the __next__() method and set them to the variables next_dog_food2 and next_dog_food3.

Print both variables to see the results!

4.
Uncomment the following line: next(dog_food_iterator)

This will call next() on the dog_food_iterator object one more time. What should we expect to see in the output? Run the code to find out!
