1.
We have another shelving unit to display by the register that can only hold 3 collars. We have a list of collars of varying colors and sizes.

We want to know how many different combinations exist to display a set of 3 collars. Use the combinations() itertool to do this. Set the returned iterator to a variable named collar_combo_iterator.

Using a for loop, print each item in collar_combo_iterator to see all the possible collar combinations.
