1.
We have three courses:

Computer Science which has 5 students
Art which has 10 students
Business which has 15 students
First, complete the generator function called course_generator that can yield tuples of (Course name, Number students) for the above courses and the corresponding number of students. The first tuple for Computer Science has been provided.


2.
We need to add 5 students to each course. Create a generator function called add_five_students that takes in an input variable called courses. This courses object contains tuples of (Course name, Number of students). The add_five_students generator function should loop through the courses input object.

On each iteration, it should yield a tuple containing the course name and number of students plus 5. The resulting generator that is yielded should have the following values:

Computer Science with 10 students
Art with 15 students
Business with 20 students.

3.
Use a pipeline generator (nested generator) to get the resulting generator that has the 5 added students to each course. Set it to a variable called increased_courses.

Print out each course tuple in the resulting increased_courses generator using a for loop.
