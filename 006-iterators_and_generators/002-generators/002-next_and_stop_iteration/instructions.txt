1.
A list student_standings of four studentâ€™s class standings is inside the generator function student_standing_generator().

Finish the function by adding a for loop that traverses through the student_standings list and yields 500 for each 'Freshman' value.

2.
Outside the function, retrieve the iterator object by calling student_standing_generator() and set it to a variable called standing_values.

3.
Print out the values within the returned standing_values generator using the Python built-in function next().

Two values of 500 should be retrieved since our student_standings list contained two 'Freshman' values.

4.
Use next() one more time on the generator object. What occurs?
