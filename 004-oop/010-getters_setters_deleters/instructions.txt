1.
Using a getter, setter, and the single underscore naming convention, the employees of the company will now be able to use their names. The single underscore attribute _name has been added to the Employee class. Names default to None unless a string argument is passed during instantiation.

Inside the Employee class:

Define a getter method called get_name() that returns the class attribute _name.

2.
Add a setter method.

Inside the Employee class:

Define a setter method set_name that has an additional parameter for the name string and sets the class attribute _name.

3.
Lastly, Add a deleter method.

Inside the Employee class:

Define a deleter method del_name that deletes the attribute.

4.
Great job defining the getter and setter. Uncomment the code at the bottom of script.py to test out the getter, setter, and deleter.

Move on to the next exercise to wrap up the lesson!
