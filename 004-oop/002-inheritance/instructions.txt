1.
Now that there is an Employee class we want to make a more specific type of employee, Admin.

Create an Admin class that inherits from the Employee class
Inside the body of the class insert the pass statement

2.
Now it’s time to test out your inheritance implementation.

At the bottom of script.py:

Define a variable e3 and set it to an instance of the Admin class
Now if you call the .say_id() method of the Admin instance in e3, you will get output with the instance’s id.
