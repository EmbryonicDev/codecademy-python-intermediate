There is now a Meeting class with an attendees list attribute and an .__add__() dunder method that adds Employee instances to the attendees list. Before we try and add employees to a meeting, we want to make sure we can know how many employees are in a meeting.

Inside the Meeting class:

Overload the len() operation by defining a __len__() dunder method
Inside the __len__() definition, return the length of the attribute attendees

Now add three employees to a meeting:

Using the Meeting instance m1, add each of the employee instances e1, e2, and e3. Use one line for each employee instance.
Output the length of meeting instance m1
You should see the output from each employee being added and then the length of the meeting, 3.
