1.
Managers decide to start walking around more to let people know who is in charge.

Inside script.py:

Define a Manager class and have it inherit from the Admin class
Inside the Manager class, define a method say_id() that outputs that they are in charge.

2.
The Managers want to set a good example so they also let people know their ID and that they are an admin.

Inside the .say_id() method of Manager:

Call the Admin class .say_id() method

3.
Now test it out.

At the bottom of script.py:

Define a variable e4 and set it to an instance of the Manager class
Call the .say_id() method of the instance in e4
Now you will get output from all 3 classes.
