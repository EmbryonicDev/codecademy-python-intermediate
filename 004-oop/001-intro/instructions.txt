1.
To start our exploration into OOP, create a class that will represent an employee of a company.


Define a class called Employee
Define a class variable new_id and set it equal to 1
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.
Each Employee instance will need its own unique ID.

Inside the Employee class:

Define an __init__() method
Inside __init__(), define self.id and set it equal to the class variable new_id
Lastly, increment new_id by 1
Checkpoint 3 Passed

3.
Now create a function to output the instance id.

Inside the Employee class:

Define a say_id() method
Inside say_id(), output the string "My id is " and then the instance id.
Checkpoint 4 Passed

4.
Lastly, create 2 employees and have them give their ids.

Outside of the Employee class:

Define the variable e1 and set it to an instance of Employee
Define the variable e2 and set it to an instance of Employee
Have both e1 and e2 output their ids
